AI Voice Changer Debug Summary
==============================

Issue: The voice generation feature keeps showing "Generating..." without returning a result.

Root Observations:
------------------
1. The UI loads correctly with Tailwind after fixing PostCSS and Tailwind issues.
2. The main request hangs during the voice generation step in `/api/voice.js`.
3. ElevenLabs API is likely not responding or receiving invalid data.

Suspected Root Causes:
----------------------
1. Environment variable `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` may be missing or incorrect.
2. ElevenLabs voice ID `EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL` may not be valid or available in your ElevenLabs account.
3. The fetch request to ElevenLabs API may be silently failing or stalling.

Recommended Checks:
-------------------
1. Check .env.local contents to ensure this line exists:
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here

2. Confirm the voice ID is valid:
   Use this command to list your voices:
   curl -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_KEY" https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices

3. Add logging to debug the issue:
   Inside `src/pages/api/voice.js`, before the fetch request to ElevenLabs, add:
   console.log("Sending to ElevenLabs:", text)

4. After deployment, run:
   npx vercel logs ai-voice-changer-<deployment-id>.vercel.app --since 10m

   Replace <deployment-id> with the latest ID from your `npx vercel --prod` command.

Fallback (Optional):
--------------------
To test the rest of your app without ElevenLabs, you can mock the audio response in development.
